✔ Session tracking & logging for user activity  
✔ Dynamic JavaFX UI
✔ Modular architecture for scalability  

## Roadmap: What’s Next? 
Multiple Game Variants – Expanding beyond Texas Hold’em to include games like Blackjack
Machine Learning AI Opponents (Python-based) – Implementing AI-driven poker players for dynamic and competitive play
Secure Authentication & Email Automation – Implementing secure password storage and automated verification emails  
Web Hosting – Deploying the game online for accessibility beyond desktop and multiplayer play 
Google Account Login – Enabling seamless sign-in with Google authentication  

## Technologies Used
Java 17+ – Core language for game logic and UI  
JavaFX (FXML) – UI framework for desktop application
MySQL – User authentication and session tracking  
Maven – Dependency management  
(Future) Python – AI-driven poker opponents
